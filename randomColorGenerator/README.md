Here is the course work from a codeacademy pro. 
This unit is from the web dev at code academy. 
This app is a color  Random Color Generator built with HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT
How  the app works 
When clicked on the button a random colour is picked,
from 255 to 0. 

The mystery colour works if you hold down the scroll wheel on your mouse while holding down the mouse button. The event is called ONWHEEL.  The ONWHEEL event doesn't work in all broswer.
